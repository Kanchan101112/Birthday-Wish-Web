    <p class="love-note" style="display:none;">💖💖 My Dearest Bubu,

From the very first moment you came into my life, something deep inside me changed — it felt as though my heart had finally found its missing piece. Every day since then has been brighter, softer, and more meaningful just because of you. I can’t imagine a world without your smile, your laughter, and the quiet strength you carry in your heart. You are not just the person I love; you are the rhythm my heart beats to, the calm in my chaos, and the dream I never want to wake up from.

Bubu, you have no idea how much you mean to me. Every time I look at you, I see everything I’ve ever wanted — warmth, understanding, care, and the kind of love that doesn’t fade with time. I love you not only for who you are but also for the way you make me feel — cherished, safe, and deeply seen. You’ve shown me that real love isn’t about perfection; it’s about presence. It’s about standing by each other through every high and low, every laughter and tear. And that’s exactly what I promise to do — today, tomorrow, and for every birthday that comes.

Each year, when your birthday arrives, it reminds me how lucky I am to celebrate you — not just as my love, but as my sweet Chunnu Pie, the incredible soul who fills my life with purpose. I want to be there for every candle you blow, every wish you make, and every moment that turns into a memory. I’ll be there to hold your hand when you’re unsure, to cheer you on when life challenges you, and to wrap you in love when words fall short.

Jaanu, you are my forever. No matter how many birthdays come and go, my heart will always belong to you — fully, endlessly, and without hesitation. I want to grow old with you, to celebrate your every victory, to comfort you in every pain, and to fill your life with the same happiness you’ve brought into mine. I want to be the one who stands beside you when the world feels too heavy, reminding you that you’re never alone.

I love you more deeply than words can ever express — more than stars love the night sky, more than waves love the shore. You’re my peace, my home, and my greatest blessing. And I promise you this from the depth of my soul: on every birthday you celebrate, you’ll find me right there beside you — loving you, celebrating you, and thanking the universe for giving me the most beautiful gift of all — you, my Bubu.

Forever yours,
With all my love,
Kuchu 💖💖</p>
